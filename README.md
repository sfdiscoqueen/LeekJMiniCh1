// Mini-Challenge #1 "Say Hello!"
// This is a simple application that will ask the user for their name, then say hello to them.
// Peer review: Arely Martinez -- Jasmine's code is very simple and neat. Her aproach very different from mine. Her's is a lot more condensed and only requires one respone. I also like the little touches on her program like the little stars. Overall very tidy, user friendly, and advances (bc o d the methods she used like /n and the $ technique ) .
